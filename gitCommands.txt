Notes:
- Working Directory -> Staging Area -> Local Repository
- Git will manage the changes between the working directory and git local Directory
- We can push our local git repo to github
- Origin is just the name of the remote repo, we use origin by convention
- You can find gitignore templates on github that are made for things like xcode, so that you dont copy your confirgurations
- A merge request is essentially a push request to the master branch of a separate branch
